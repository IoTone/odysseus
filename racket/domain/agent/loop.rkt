;; domain/agent/loop.rkt — the agent loop's *control spine*, as a pure driver.
;;
;; src/agent_loop.py is 2644 lines, but most of it is prompt assembly, endpoint
;; detection, retrieval, and LLM/tool I/O. The actual state machine is small and
;; universal:
;;
;;   each round: ask the model →
;;     • no tool calls  → the text is the final answer            → DONE
;;     • tool calls     → run them, feed results back, next round → CONTINUE
;;     • round cap hit                                            → MAX-ROUNDS
;;
;; Here that spine is a deterministic function with the two effects *injected*
;; (#:llm and #:exec), so it's testable without a model or real tools — and the
;; I/O adapter (real LLM client + tool executor) is the only impure part, kept
;; at the edges. Tool calls arrive as `tool-block`s (from domain/tools/convert).

;; (as tool-blocks for #:exec), and the *raw* OpenAI tool_call objects aligned
;; 1:1 with tool-blocks — so the loop can echo them back in the real protocol
;; (assistant.tool_calls + role:"tool" with tool_call_id). Strict chat templates
;; (e.g. local qwen via ollama) require this; lenient ones (gpt-4o) don't, but
;; sending it is correct for both. raw-calls may be '() (e.g. in unit tests),
